# Android Kotlin Demo 2 Simple View Binding

Android View Binding is a feature introduced by Google in Android Studio 3.6 that simplifies the process of accessing views in your Android app's layout files. It generates a binding class for each XML layout file, allowing you to access and manipulate views directly using the generated binding class.

Prior to View Binding, developers typically used findViewById() method to obtain references to views in their activities or fragments. However, this approach required manual casting and was prone to runtime errors if the view ID was mistyped. View Binding eliminates these issues by generating a binding class that provides direct access to views without the need for casting or null checks.
